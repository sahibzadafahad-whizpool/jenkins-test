Note For the Developer :%

I have used Angular 6 , Express Framework and Mysql DB for the development of website.
When i was writing code for the project , i was new and i didnt know anything about Angular , Node so therefore code 
is not clean and not well structured. I know when you will open the code ( YOU will think WTF man who wrote such a unstructured code ) , so sorry for the unstructured code :D
